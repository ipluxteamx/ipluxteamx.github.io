      <h2>aqua system</h2>
      <p>
        Aqua System is a hobby operating system i've been working on for a
        while.<br />
        i made it using the Cosmos OS framework/kit, which is a C# kit for
        making OSes.<br /><br />

        this project is my second longest project to date (without pauses),
        <br />after Friday Night Ghostin' having debuted in the 16th of January
        2023.<br /><br />

        i'm still doing this project, but i'm not working on it as much as i
        used to,<br />mainly because of school and my mental health.<br /><br />

        i am also out of ideas for this project, but i am trying to think of
        some.<br /><br />

        the GitHub repo link is
        <a href="https://github.com/ipluxteamx/Aqua">here</a>,<br />
        go take a look at it if you want to, would make me happy.

      <h2>friday night ghostin'</h2>
      <p>
        Friday Night Ghostin', or FNG' for short, is a mod for Friday Night
        Funkin'<br />
        i started doing in early-mid 2021, and cancelled it recently for<br />
        mental health and other reasons<br />(mainly the fact that no one was
        working on it for a long time).<br /><br />

        it was done mainly on Psych Engine or forks of it,<br />and i was the
        only main and lead programmer for the mod.<br /><br />

        the mod is about some ghosts with each ghost having a different
        personality.<br />
        there was also going to have a gloop demon called Gloopy that was going
        to be the<br />
        main vilain of the mod (v2).<br /><br />

        there were other people working with me, like Samy, Luxane, and others.
