			<h2>Who am I?</h2>

			<p>
				I'm a 15 year old guy from France who likes to make stuff, like music, games, and other things.
				<br>I'm probably known for my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ipluxOyasumi">YouTube channel</a>, where I upload FNF music and other music (like songs from my album, which is coming soon).
				<br>I also have a <a href="https://twitter.com/ybngem_">Twitter account</a>, where I post random stuff and make jokes (either French ones or English ones).
				<br>My Discord account is <b>@iplux</b>, I have no Discord server at the moment lol.

				<br><br>The best way to contact me is through Discord or YouTube comments.
