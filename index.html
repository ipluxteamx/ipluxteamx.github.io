      <p>
        welcome to my homepage. this is where you are gonna see all of my
        projects.
        <br />
        my primary stuff goes into
        <a href="https://youtube.com/ipluxOyasumi">youtube</a>, where i make
        music and other kewl stuff. <br /><br />

        when i'm not doing that, i'm probably working on Aqua System, <br />
        my own operating system made in C#, or working on this website.<br />
        <br />

        i must thank GitHub and Namecheap for hosting this website for free,
        <br />
        and providing me with a cool ass A.I. extension that completes code.

        i love coding!! i'm a self-taught programmer, and i'm still learning.<br /><br />

        i have a fascination for operating system,<br />
